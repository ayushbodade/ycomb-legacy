      "Meesho – short for Meri Shop (My Shop) – was founded by Vidit Aatery and Sanjeev Barnwal in 2015. Vidit and Sanjeev were wing mates at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi hostel, with their rooms located diagonally opposite each other. Upon completion of their engineering, Vidit worked with Indian consumer goods major ITC for a couple of years, followed by a year-long stint at ad-tech startup InMobi. Sanjeev joined Sony in Japan, contributing to the camera technology for DSLRs and mobiles. ****\\The duo got back in touch in May 2015 and decided to start up. For them, two things were clear.  One, it was a great time to be a tech entrepreneur in India – doing anything else would mean not living up to their potential. Two, solving a large-scale problem that affects more than 100 million people and something they can relate to. \\Soon, Vidit and Sanjeev realized that most small businesses in India were still offline. They only sold within their communities and localities, which limited their earning potential. \\On the consumer side, traditional e-commerce companies focused on the metros and relatively affluent consumers, leaving smaller cities and those with lower incomes out of the internet commerce revolution. Vidit and Sanjeev wanted to take the benefits of e-commerce to this cohort of consumers, democratizing internet commerce for everyone. \\To that end, Vidit and Sanjeev gauged the immense potential of social networks as a sales channel early on. They created a platform that enabled millions of people, including homemakers, to become entrepreneurs and resell products in their network via WhatsAp. Meesho pioneered social commerce in India and it now has ~16 million entrepreneurs on the platform, of which over 10 million are women. \\What started as an idea to digitize India’s unorganized retail is now a $4.9B e-commerce company, a single thriving ecosystem of sellers, entrepreneurs and consumers.

Affordable, relatable merchandise mirroring local markets has helped Meesho make inroads into homes of first-time internet users across the country. The company’s 85 million+ active product listings and strong value prop of everyday low prices has resulted in 140 million annual transacting users. On the seller side, the company’s relentless focus on digitizing small businesses is bearing fruit. Driven by industry-first initiatives such as zero commission and by ensuring there’s no private label play or tiering of sellers, Meesho’s supplier base has grown to over 825,000. Three in five of them are new-to-e-commerce and selling on Meesho for the first time. One of the reasons Meesho is able to deliver on its promise of everyday low prices is because of its asset-light structure, wherein it works with third-party logistics players for order fulfillment. Meesho is the single-largest contributor to India’s fast-growing third-party logistics industry, accounting for ~35% of all shipments delivered by national players.\n",

      "Meesho — India’s only true online marketplace — is altering the status quo with an asset-light business model to make e-commerce inclusive and accessible for the next billion users in India.Over the last 15 years, e-commerce in India evolved with a focus on convenience-seeking customers in metros and Tier 1 cities with enough purchasing power. Much less attention was paid to residents of smaller towns and those from lower income groups with different needs around selection and affordability. Meesho is constantly working towards enabling access for this cohort of customers, reimagining the internet commerce journey for them. Over the last seven years, the company has built a simple and easy-to-use e-commerce platform that’s helped millions of new-to-ecommerce users come online. The company currently has close to ~140 million annual transacting customers. Additionally, Meesho’s vision is to enable the smallest of sellers in India to digitize their business and reap the benefits of online commerce: a much bigger market, higher incomes, a digital footprint, et al. Driven by this vision, Meesho has routinely identified and solved the challenges that potentially deter sellers from embracing e-commerce. The company launched disruptive, industry-first initiatives like zero seller commission that leave more money in the hands of suppliers and allow them to expand their business. As India’s only true e-commerce marketplace, Meesho does not differentiate between sellers on the basis of tiers, nor does it have private labels or an inventory-led play. Meesho was built on the core principle of democratization of internet commerce for the smallest of sellers across the country.\n",

      "Creating a level playing field for small businesses to succeed online while catering to underserved, price-sensitive users — Meesho is on a mission to democratize internet commerce for everyone. India’s unorganized retail is estimated to account for 85% of the overall retail sector, indicating a huge opportunity for small businesses and consumers to come online. All that is required is the right platform and opportunity, a little bit of resources and some hand holding. Additionally, of the ~700M active internet users in India, only 216M transact online. There is a large chunk of people in tier 2+ cities who do not transact online. Meesho’s vision is to bring underserved users into the e-commerce fold by leveraging technology, its wide reach and strong understanding of how India shops. If Meesho truly succeeds, small businesses will be empowered to sell their wares across the country, earn more and generate employment at scale, taking India closer to its goal of a $5 trillion economy. On the other hand, consumers will be able to access affordable, relatable merchandise from all corners of the country, fulfilling their aspirations.\n",
